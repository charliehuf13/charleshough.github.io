  <h1>Professional Journal</h1>

  <p>This space is dedicated to reflections and logs throughout my academic and research journey. Whether it’s challenges in model tuning, observations from the lab, or thoughts on where science and society intersect — this journal captures the process behind the product.</p>

  <h2>Entry: Debugging Dorado Correct (March 2025)</h2>
  <p>Spent the week testing parameter shifts in Dorado Correct while working with base calling errors in Oxford Nanopore reads. Observed improvements using more aggressive normalization, but it led to fragmentation on specific genome regions. Next step: integrate external control datasets for comparative benchmarks.</p>

  <h2>Entry: Reflections from BI221 Office Hours (October 2024)</h2>
  <p>Had three students open up about their struggle with Mendelian genetics. I redesigned next week’s activities to be more tactile, using Punnett square manipulations with real-world phenotypic examples. Their response was unexpectedly enthusiastic — made me rethink how I approach abstract content.</p>
