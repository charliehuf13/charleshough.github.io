  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm Charles Hough — a Biology major at Oregon State University with minors in Chemistry and Biochemistry/Molecular Biology, currently set to graduate in Spring 2026. I’m passionate about the intersection of molecular science and technology, and I thrive in environments that challenge me to think critically, lead creatively, and contribute meaningfully to research.</p>

  <p>I’ve conducted research in bioinformatics, studying gene prediction and signal correction in oomycete genomes with deep learning tools such as Helixer and Dorado Correct. My lab experiences also span soil biodiversity, ecological modeling, marine biology, and nematode identification through PCR and gel electrophoresis.</p>

  <p>My leadership journey includes serving as Vice-President of the OSU Integrative Biology Club and mentoring students as a Learning Assistant. These roles have shaped my collaborative mindset and commitment to inclusive learning environments, especially within scientific education.</p>

  <p>As someone who has lived with hearing loss, I deeply value accessibility, diversity, and representation in science. These convictions fuel my ambition to work in fields like infectiology and immunology, contributing to human health and equity through research.</p>

  <p>This website is my professional log — a space to share my growth, projects, and reflections with those who value rigorous inquiry, genuine leadership, and purposeful innovation.</p>
