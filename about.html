        <h2>About Charles Hough</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my professional journey in computational biology and research.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Academic Background</h2>
    <p>I am a senior at Oregon State University pursuing a B.S. in Biology with minors in Chemistry and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology. Driven by a deep interest in genetics, evolution, and data-driven discovery, I have intentionally focused my coursework on areas such as Genetics, Organic Chemistry, Evolutionary Biology, Python for Molecular Biologists, and Cell & Molecular Biology. These experiences sparked my passion for computational biology, particularly the use of quantitative methods to understand genomic mechanisms and evolutionary processes.</p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>Since Fall 2024, I have been a research assistant in Dr. Jeff Chang's laboratory at OSU, which focuses on plantâ€“microbe interactions. My current project involves generating high-quality genome assemblies and comparative genomic analyses for Phytophthora species (oomycetes of agricultural and ecological importance).</p>
    
    <p>In the Chang Lab, I regularly run genome annotation, comparison, and visualization pipelines; train machine-learning models for improved species-specific annotation; collaborate with postdoctoral researchers; and contribute visualizations for research posters and presentations. Looking ahead, I aspire to continue using computational tools to better understand genomic variation and leverage those insights in fields such as infectious disease, immunology, and precision medicine.</p>

    <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
    <h3>Software & Pipelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Genome annotation & assessment:</strong> Helixer, BUSCO, AGAT, EarlGrey, OMARK</li>
      <li><strong>Genome comparison & synteny:</strong> GENESPACE, nf-core/pairgenomealign, MUMmer (nucmer, show-coords), Dorado Correct</li>
      <li><strong>Genome characterization & QC:</strong> Smudgeplot, K-mer profiling tools</li>
      <li><strong>Workflow management:</strong> Nextflow, Singularity, SLURM-based HPC scheduling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Languages & Data Visualization</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>R (tidyverse, ape, ggtree)</strong> â€“ development of publication-quality phylogenetic trees, repeat-density plots, and genome annotation visualizations</li>
      <li><strong>Python</strong> â€“ entry-level experience via course Python for Molecular Biologists (BB 345)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Computing Environments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>GPU-enabled pipelines (CUDA-based annotation models)</li>
      <li>CPU-intensive comparative genomics workflows on HPC clusters (OSU CQLS)</li>
      <li>Linux/Unix command line, resource allocation (memory, CPUs, storage), and shell scripting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Professional Goals</h2>
    <p>Upon graduating in June 2026, I aim to pursue opportunities in computational biology, bioinformatics, genomics, or infectious disease research â€” either in academic graduate programs or industry-based R&D settings. I'm excited by roles that blend scientific innovation, collaborative teamwork, and mission-driven problem-solving. Long-term, I hope to continue contributing to advances at the intersection of biology and data science.</p>

    <h2>I'm More Than Just a Scientist!</h2>
    <p>Outside of research, I enjoy running, hiking, rock climbing, and exploring the outdoors. I am also passionate about leadership and community building: I currently serve as Vice-President of OSU's Integrative Biology Club (500+ members) and have held multiple leadership roles in my fraternity, including Alumni Relations Chair, Inter-Fraternity Council Delegate, and Event Emcee.</p>
